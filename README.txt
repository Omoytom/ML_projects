This repository is for my Machine learning projects
The Spaceship Titanic was a competition I joined on Kaggle
The bluechip was a a competition I used Logistic Regression and some other Algorithm
The bluechip(Tensor).py is the same competition with Tensor
The mnist folder contains two project, The first from the mnist dataset, and the second from the fashion_mnist dataset
The shapes project is a Convolutional Neural network to classify basic shapes(Circle, Square, Triangle and Rectangle) using a synthetic dataset
